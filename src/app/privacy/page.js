        <p>If you fear for your privacy and data, please go use a platform you trust more, but we do not recommend Facebook, Instagram, TikTok etc.. - we have heard they have done some bad stuff with their user data in the past - but we cannot be sure, this is not an accusation, more of a musing.</p>
        <p>Anyway, no privacy here - use the website if you want, else -have a nice day!</p>

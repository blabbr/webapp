      <p>This is a chat site. Like the ones from the 90s. Here's how it works.</p>
      <p>You go into a chat room, set a nick (nickname) and then you chat with whoever is in there</p>
      <p>There are no accounts, no passwords, no email addresses, no phone numbers, no nothing.</p>
      <p>Just a nickname and a chat room.</p>
      <p>That's it.</p>
      <p>That's the whole thing.</p>
      <p>It's a chat room.</p>
      <p>When you want to leave, or stop chatting, or someone upsets you - you close the window or tab and that's the end of that</p>
      <br />
      <p><b>There's no history, no logs, no nothing.</b></p>
      <p>That's the cool part</p>
      <p>It's like a real life conversation</p>
      <p>Once it's over, it's over</p>
      <p>There's no record of it</p>
      <p>It's just gone</p>
      <br />
        <p className="text-4xl">So, what's the point?</p>

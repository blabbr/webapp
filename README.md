# blabbr.buzz front end
This is the webapp for http://blabbr.buzz

blabbr.buzz is a simple chat application that is being developed in the open for fun.

All the code to run the website (and any apps in the future) will probably be found here. If it is going to be somewhere else or inaccessible then you will be notified here. The objective here is to build as mmuch in the open and as transparently as possible.

If you find any issues, please feel free to comment and/or make a PR.

You can also email me at vineet@blabbr.buzz -I will do my best to respond but make no commitments to do so.
